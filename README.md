Our project offers a comprehensive exploration of AI-based security solutions aimed at enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of remote healthcare monitoring systems. By integrating attribute-based encryption, secure hashing techniques, and patient-controlled data sharing mechanisms, we have demonstrated a robust framework to address security challenges and ensure the protection of patient data in remote healthcare environments. Through the design, development, and implementation of an AI-based security framework, our project provides a practical approach to mitigating security risks and ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of patient information. The findings underscore the significance of integrating advanced technologies and methodologies to tackle emerging healthcare challenges and propel the field of remote healthcare monitoring forward. In essence, the integration of AI-driven security solutions within our project marks a significant step towards fortifying the resilience and efficiency of remote healthcare systems. By prioritizing privacy and security through innovative technological measures, we contribute to creating a more secure and reliable remote healthcare monitoring landscape, benefiting both patients and healthcare providers. Moving forward, continued research and collaboration will be essential to refining and enhancing these technologies, ultimately advancing the field of remote healthcare monitoring for the betterment of healthcare delivery. As remote healthcare monitoring continues to evolve and expand, our project emphasizes the need for flexible and scalable security solutions that can grow and evolve alongside the changing needs of patients and healthcare providers.
